# Loan Prediction Project

This project implements a machine learning model to predict loan approval status based on various applicant characteristics. The model helps financial institutions make data-driven decisions about loan applications.

## Project Overview

The project uses machine learning techniques to analyze applicant data and predict whether a loan application should be approved or rejected. The model takes into account various features such as:
- Applicant's income
- Credit history
- Employment status
- Loan amount
- And other relevant financial indicators
